                    <p class="east-india_p">The city of Baramulla, from which the district derives its name, was founded by Raja Bhimsina in 2306 BC. The city held the position of a gate-way to the valley as it was located on the route to the Valley from Muzaffarabad, now in POK, and Rawalpindi, now in Pakistan.
As such, a number of prominent visitors have been to Baramulla. These include the famous Chinese visitor Heiun T’Sang and Moorcraft, the British historian. Mughal Emperors had special fascination for Baramulla. Being the gateway of the valley, it was a halting station for them during their visits to the Valley. In 1508 AD, Emperor Akbar who entered the Valley via Pakhil spent a few days at Baramulla and according to “Tarikh-e-Hassan” the city during Akbar’s stay, had been decorated like a bride. Jahangir also stayed at Baramulla during his visit to Kashmir in 1620 AD. </p>

                    <p class="east-india_p1">Gulmarg is a small village in the Pir Panjal peaks of India, located at the extreme western edge of 1 of the 6 mountain ranges that form the Himalayan Mountains. Gulmarg was established as a ski resort in 1927 by two British Army officers but was originally a hill station for wealthy tourists looking to beat the summer heat. It was a favorite vacation spot for Mughal kings and later for the British elite during their Indian occupancy.

Phase II of the Gulmarg gondola was added in 2005, which stops just below Mt. Apharwat's summit (4,124 meters), offering additional challenging runs and beautiful views of the Kashmir landscape.Gulmarg is located in India, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir - not far from the India / Pakistan border. Gulmarg's geography makes it an ideal location to ski Himalaya. It's 52 km from Srinagar, Kashmir's state capital. And at an elevation of 2,650 meters, Gulmarg receives some of the heaviest snowfall in the Himalayas.

Gulmarg is translated as "Meadow of Flowers" and is also home to the highest golf course in the world!

                    <p class="east-india_p">
                      Located 95 km from Srinagar at a height of 7200 ft, Pahalgam, known as the ‘Valley of Shepherds’, is a famous hill station in Jammu and Kashmir where many films have been shot. Standing at the confluence of Lidder river and the Sheshnag lake, Pahalgam is surrounded by thickly wooded pine forests, breathtaking vistas of meadows and the snow-clad Himalayan mountains.

Serving as the base camp during the Amarnath Yatra, the Pahalgam-Chandanwati-Amarnath route is preferred by tourists trying to reach the mountain cave of Lord Shiva. The town also holds an amazing two-day long Snow Festival that showcases winter sports like skiing, snow-sledging and many more which tourists can participate in. Other activities that tourists can indulge in are golf, trekking and angling.

Apart from being a pilgrimage site, Pahalgam is also a treat for adventure junkies and is the starting point for several treks. However, the highlight of the activities available for tourists is the white water rafting facility winding down the Lidder River through the forests and down the rapids.

While shopping in Pahalgam, remember that there are only three banks with ATM machines (SBI, HDFC and J&K) and hawkers will ask for five times the rate of the product, so don’t forget to bargain. However, the Kashmiri shawls, carpets and clothing with chain-stitch embroidery are beautiful and a must buy.
