                    <p class="east-india_p">An Architecture Marvel of India's heritage, Konark Sun Temple,
                         commonly known as Konark is situated in the eastern state of Odisha (earlier known as Orissa),
                          India and is one of the eminent tourist attractions. Konark houses a massive temple dedicated 
                          to the Sun God. The word 'Konark' is a combination of two words 'Kona' and 'Arka'. 'Kona' means 
                          'Corner' and 'Arka' means 'Sun', so when combines it becomes 'Sun of the Corner'. Konark Sun 
                          Temple is situated on the north eastern corner of Puri and is dedicated to Sun God.
                          Dedicated to the Hindu Sun God Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of 
                          a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 
                          feet (61 m) high,[1][5] much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over
                           the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains.  </p>

                        It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites in India, and is also well-known for the annual chariot festival or Rath Yatra.
                        If various legends are to be believed, King Indradyumn built this holy shrine after Lord Vishnu blessed and guided him in his dreams to find Nila Madhava.
                        It was during one of the holy dips in the river, King Indradyumn found an iron rod floating. It is believed that Lord Vishnu then whispered to him that the floating rod is his heart, which will
                        remain on the land forever.

                        The lagoon hosts over 160 species of birds in the peak migratory season. Birds from as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal, Aral Sea and other remote parts of Russia, Kirghiz steppes of Kazakhstan, Central and southeast Asia, Ladakh and Himalayas come here. These birds travel great distances; migratory birds probably follow much longer routes than the straight lines, possibly up to 12,000 km, to reach Chilika Lake.
                        In 1981, Chilika Lake was designated the first Indian wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.[12][13]
                        According to a survey, 45 percent of the birds are terrestrial in nature, 32 percent are waterfowl, and 23 percent are waders. The lagoon is also home to 14 types of raptors. Around 152 rare and endangered Irrawaddy dolphins have also been reported. Plus, the lagoon supports about 37 species of reptiles and amphibians.</p>
