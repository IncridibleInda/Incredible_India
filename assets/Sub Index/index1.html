                    <p class="east-india_p">One of the most popular places to visit in Darjeeling, DHR is approximately a 2 feet narrow gauge train track that covers the distance between New Jalpaiguri 
                    and Darjeeling. This 88-km long railway track is best known for its toy train which gushes amid the misty hill side and offers absolutely gorgeous views of the valley. 
                    The construction of this historic railways began in 1879 and took about two years for it to be finished. For its significance as a popular tourist spot, it was declared 
                    as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. The ride in the toy train of Himalayan Railways Station is both adventurous as well relaxing in nature.
                    If there is one thing that you shouldn’t miss during your time in Darjeeling, it’s a ride in the toy train. No wonder it tops the list of the best 
                    tourist attractions in Darjeeling. </p>

                         The most unique part of Sundarbans relates to the fact that it is the largest mangrove forest in the world with a large
                         concentration of Royal Bengal Tigers. Some 78 species of mangroves
                         are recorded across the forest. It also plays a vital role in the survival of marine organisms as it works as a wetland 
                         nursery to them.
                        The pride of West Benga, India, Sundarbans covers an area of around 10,000km2 in the delta of Ganges. It lies on the 
                        south-east of Kolkata and borders the Bay of Bengal. This wonderful biosphere reserve houses many rare and endangered 
                        animals including aquatic mammals, tigers, birds and reptiles. Sundarbans is mainly located at the confluence of Ganga and Brahmaputra basin in between India and Bangladesh. </p>

                        Kolkata, India's second biggest city, is a perpetually ongoing festival of human existence, 
                        concurrently luxurious and squalid, refined and frantic, pointedly futuristic, while beautifully in decay.
                        A vibrant 350-year-old metropolis located on India's Eastern Coast, the capital of West Bengal thrives on 
                        contradictions and imposing spectacles; nothing is commonplace in this city. Famously known as the City of Joy, 
                        Kolkata is, in every sense, the artistic, cultural and intellectual capital of the country. Kolkata's streets are vivid, 
                        hectic, chaotic, and yet, brimming with life and creativity. Driven by the indomitable spirit of the self-made middle class, 
                        the city has created a beautiful juxtaposition of the old colonial-era charm with the nascent upcoming hipster culture that 
                        thrives amongst the city's millennial residents. </p>
