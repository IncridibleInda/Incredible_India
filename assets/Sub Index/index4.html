                        You can bag the best time of your vacation at Butterfly Beach which is north of Palolem Beach in Southern Goa. Enjoy your solitude, away from the rest of the world and also experience the wonderful aquatic life out in the open front of the beach.
                        To reach here, you can hop on a ferry from Palolem or Agonda beaches as this beautiful and semi-circled beach is not approachable by any other means. For wider and punctuated experience, you can opt for a ship ride too. And if you are feeling too thrilled, you can try out trekking around the thick forest surrounding this beach. 
                        Butterfly beach is also popularly known as Honeymoon Beach as a lot of honeymooners and couples come here for a secluded vacation. You can spend your day with your partner by enjoying a picnic with wine.
