                    <p class="east-india_p">Paradise Beach or Plage Paradiso as it is known, is a popular tourist destination of Chunnambar. This Pondicherry beach got its name because of the peaceful experience it offers to its visitors. To access this beach, you need to take a boat ride from the town of Pondicherry. This is also one of the reasons why the beach got its current identity.

This isolated beach of Pondicherry is a great weekend respite to enjoy with your family, friends, and relatives. After enjoying a boat ride from Pondicherry town to the Paradise beach, visitors usually relax on the extraordinarily soft sands of the shore.

The beach route between Pondicherry town and the Paradise Beach itself is mesmerizing. It has an unparalleled charm with its thick mangrove forest cover making the backwaters appear green. If you had a chance to explore Paradise Beach immediately after the monsoons, the backwaters here appear fresh and lush green.  </p>

                    <p class="east-india_p1">The concept of Auroville - an ideal township devoted to an experiment in human unity - came to the Mother as early as the 1930s. In the mid 1960s the concept was developed and put before the Govt. of India, who gave their backing and took it to the General Assembly of UNESCO. In 1966 UNESCO passed a unanimous resolution commending it as a project of importance to the future of humanity, thereby giving their full encouragement.The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity – in diversity. Today Auroville is recognised as the first and only internationally endorsed ongoing experiment in human unity and transformation of consciousness, also concerned with - and practically researching into - sustainable living and the future cultural, environmental, social and spiritual needs of mankind.Auroville is located in south India, mostly in the State of Tamil Nadu (some parts are in the State of Puducherry), a few kilometres inland from the Coromandel Coast, approx 150 kms south of Chennai (previously Madras) and 10 kms north of the town of Puducherry.
